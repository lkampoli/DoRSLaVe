Project \n\n> \"Having an open ended project allowed me to do something I had interest in.\"\n\n> \"The assignment was really good as it gave you ownership of what problem to\nchoose and investigate. The course itself is super interesting and insightful,\nand really practical since time isn't wasted on coding but rather the concepts\nand how to apply these models.\"\n\n## The style\n\n> \"I think the hands–on approach to learning how to code up CFD solver was\nquite useful. Not going too deeply into the inner workings models (some ways\nthis might happen would be deriving certian formulas and proofs of certian\ntheorems) allowed us to devote more attention to learning how worked in an\nintuitive way. This perhaps is more helpful for a first timer to the subject\narea. I think that being too entrenched in the theorem–and–proof style of\nlearning, though instilling rigor to the course as well as being entertaining\nto the geniuses and masochists, can make content too heavy and turgid for most.\nHaving a lighter approach is more suitable to the needs of us students and \nallows us to gain a sufficient grasp of more types of numerical CFD solvers.\"\n\n## Comments put in the wrong form\n\nNot about the course but about me:\n\n> \"crazy amount of interest in field demonstrated by lecturer. Amazing personality.\"\n\n> \"He carried some of that young energy with him.\"\n\n## Improvements\n\n_What could be improved?_\n\n> \"More time for the project and removal of the final exam. I believe this\nproject can reflect the real world even more if we had more time.\"\n\nThere were others related to deadlines and number of assignment tasks, which\nwere already implemented.\n\nThe next slides are answering the question: \n_Is there anything you wish you could have told your former self before\nstarting to help them be prepared to learn these topics?_\n\n## Brushing up on Maths, Physics and Coding\n\n> \"In hindsight, a piece of advice I would give my past self before starting\nthis course would be to have a solid grasp of basic mathematical manipulations.\nI believe reinstating such prerequisites would greatly enhance the ability for\nstudents to fully thrive in this course.\"\n\n> \"Something I wish I could have told my former self before taking this course,\nwas to brush up on general Fortran/C++/Python skills\".\n\n## Time management\n\n> \"If I could give advice to my former self it would be to start the project\nearly and try to read ahead. Looking forward, I hope to continue to be able to\nlearn more about propulsion and rocket science and am glad to have been exposed\nto resources like real numerical solvers.\"\n\n> \"Something that I would have told my former self before starting is to not\nfall behind in the early stages of the term as the first couple weeks really\nbuilds the foundation for the remaining weeks of the term. Because I fell\nbehind earlier, it was quite difficult for me to catch up during the rest of\nthe term.\"\n\n> \"Moreover, I would still ask myself to start assignments earlier instead of leaving until the last minute.\"\n\n## Planning\n\n> \"If I could tell my former self something before starting, it would be to\nreally focus on understanding the concepts first before jumping into coding the\ntechniques. I think I could have saved a lot of time in the assignment if I\nspent more time understanding the concepts in more depth instead of rushing\ninto the coding aspect of things.\"\n\n> \"In terms of the assignment and coding I would have told my former self to do\nthings properly the first time rather than doing a rough job and having to go\nback and fix it. Going back and altering early code can lead to really\nfrustrating problems later so I would have told myself to not be lazy in the\ninitial stages because it makes life a lot easier towards the end of the\nproject.\"\n\n## Patience\n\n> \"If I could go back and advise my former self before starting the course, I\nwould emphasise the importance of patience. Rocket science can be quite\nchallenging, and it's easy to get discouraged when facing complex models\nand dependences. I would advise myself to just clear my mind then come\nback when this happens, rather than rack my brain for hours to no avail.\"\n\n> \"If I was give some advice to my former self, I would say that coding takes a\nlong time to master and be prepared to put in the time and effort. There were\nsome assignments which I really struggled to understand the concept, resulting\nin many errors (some of which were just caused by language behaviour I was not\naware of) and many hours of debugging.\"\n\n## Don't panic\n\n> \"If I could go back to tell my former self (when I was struggling to work\nwith the first ever assignment), I would tell myself that do not panic and read\nthe lecture slides carefully. The slides are actually extremely helpful in\ntackling the assignment questions.\"\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Your lecturer\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n![Dr. Lorenzo Campoli](Lorenzo-Campoli.png)\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"65%\"}\n\n<br>\n\n- Bachelor in Aerospace Eng.

The course itself is super interesting and insightful,\nand really practical since time isn't wasted on coding but rather the concepts\nand how to apply these models.\"\n\n## The style\n\n> \"I think the hands–on approach to learning how to code up CFD solver was\nquite useful. Not going too deeply into the inner workings models (some ways\nthis might happen would be deriving certian formulas and proofs of certian\ntheorems) allowed us to devote more attention to learning how worked in an\nintuitive way. This perhaps is more helpful for a first timer to the subject\narea. I think that being too entrenched in the theorem–and–proof style of\nlearning, though instilling rigor to the course as well as being entertaining\nto the geniuses and masochists, can make content too heavy and turgid for most.\nHaving a lighter approach is more suitable to the needs of us students and \nallows us to gain a sufficient grasp of more types of numerical CFD solvers.\"\n\n## Comments put in the wrong form\n\nNot about the course but about me:\n\n> \"crazy amount of interest in field demonstrated by lecturer. Amazing personality.\"\n\n> \"He carried some of that young energy with him.\"\n\n## Improvements\n\n_What could be improved?_\n\n> \"More time for the project and removal of the final exam. I believe this\nproject can reflect the real world even more if we had more time.\"\n\nThere were others related to deadlines and number of assignment tasks, which\nwere already implemented.\n\nThe next slides are answering the question: \n_Is there anything you wish you could have told your former self before\nstarting to help them be prepared to learn these topics?_\n\n## Brushing up on Maths, Physics and Coding\n\n> \"In hindsight, a piece of advice I would give my past self before starting\nthis course would be to have a solid grasp of basic mathematical manipulations.\nI believe reinstating such prerequisites would greatly enhance the ability for\nstudents to fully thrive in this course.\"\n\n> \"Something I wish I could have told my former self before taking this course,\nwas to brush up on general Fortran/C++/Python skills\".\n\n## Time management\n\n> \"If I could give advice to my former self it would be to start the project\nearly and try to read ahead. Looking forward, I hope to continue to be able to\nlearn more about propulsion and rocket science and am glad to have been exposed\nto resources like real numerical solvers.\"\n\n> \"Something that I would have told my former self before starting is to not\nfall behind in the early stages of the term as the first couple weeks really\nbuilds the foundation for the remaining weeks of the term. Because I fell\nbehind earlier, it was quite difficult for me to catch up during the rest of\nthe term.\"\n\n> \"Moreover, I would still ask myself to start assignments earlier instead of leaving until the last minute.\"\n\n## Planning\n\n> \"If I could tell my former self something before starting, it would be to\nreally focus on understanding the concepts first before jumping into coding the\ntechniques. I think I could have saved a lot of time in the assignment if I\nspent more time understanding the concepts in more depth instead of rushing\ninto the coding aspect of things.\"\n\n> \"In terms of the assignment and coding I would have told my former self to do\nthings properly the first time rather than doing a rough job and having to go\nback and fix it. Going back and altering early code can lead to really\nfrustrating problems later so I would have told myself to not be lazy in the\ninitial stages because it makes life a lot easier towards the end of the\nproject.\"\n\n## Patience\n\n> \"If I could go back and advise my former self before starting the course, I\nwould emphasise the importance of patience. Rocket science can be quite\nchallenging, and it's easy to get discouraged when facing complex models\nand dependences. I would advise myself to just clear my mind then come\nback when this happens, rather than rack my brain for hours to no avail.\"\n\n> \"If I was give some advice to my former self, I would say that coding takes a\nlong time to master and be prepared to put in the time and effort. There were\nsome assignments which I really struggled to understand the concept, resulting\nin many errors (some of which were just caused by language behaviour I was not\naware of) and many hours of debugging.\"\n\n## Don't panic\n\n> \"If I could go back to tell my former self (when I was struggling to work\nwith the first ever assignment), I would tell myself that do not panic and read\nthe lecture slides carefully. The slides are actually extremely helpful in\ntackling the assignment questions.\"\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":{"beamer_presentation":{"keep_tex":true}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":false,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","strip-comments":true,"html-math-method":"katex","highlight-style":"../blue-pygments.theme","syntax-definitions":["../python.xml"],"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","toc":true,"shift-heading-level-by":1,"output-file":"lecture0.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
