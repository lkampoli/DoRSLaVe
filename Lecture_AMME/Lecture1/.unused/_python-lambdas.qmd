# Lambda functions {visibility="uncounted"}

## Anonymous 'lambda' functions {auto-animate="true"}

Example: how to sort strings by their second letter?

```{python}
names = ["Josephine", "Patrick", "Bert"]
```

If you try `help(sorted)` you'll find the `key` parameter.


```{python}
for name in names:
    print(f"The length of '{name}' is {len(name)}.")
```

```{python}
sorted(names, key=len)
```

Don't use `lambda` as a variable name!
You commonly see `lambd` or `lambda_` or `Î»`.
