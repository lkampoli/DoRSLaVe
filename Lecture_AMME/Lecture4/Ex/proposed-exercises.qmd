- **Chamber Pressure**: $p_c$ = 3.59 MPa
- **Specific Impulse**: $I_{sp}$ = 186.6 s

### 4.4 Calculate the characteristic velocity of a rocket engine with the following properties:
- **Vacuum Thrust**: 
- **Sea-Level Thrust**:
- **Chamber Pressure**: 
- **Vacuum Specific Impulse**:
- **Expansion Ratio**: 

Also, calculate the thrust coefficient at sea level and in a vacuum. Given that `A  T B S » &` and the average molecular weight of combustion products is `  & B ¿ 3 . 3 2 ¡ Ó`, calculate the combustion temperature.

Calculate the specific impulse and characteristic velocity, assuming the nozzle expansion ratio is `o  =  . ` and the engine operates in a vacuum. What is the propellant saving achieved by using a nozzle with `o  &  ` instead of `o  » ` for a maneuver with `Ú Ë  »    2  .` Consider that the payload is ` 8  B    ¿ 3` and the engine mass is ` Ø  = e  B   3 ¿` in the first case and ` Ø  = )  B  &¿ 3` in the second, with the remaining structural mass proportional to the propellant mass with `Ø Û  5   Ø  5 .   5   Ø  5    S B`, defining the structural mass as `    Ø  5   Ø  = .`

Note that the propellant saving is relatively small (`& Ð`) even considering there was no reduction in initial mass, which would have decreased the propellant mass needed for satellite launch.

- **Average Molecular Weight**:

### 4.7 Consider the propulsion system from the previous exercise. Given that it provides a vacuum thrust of $F_{vac}$ = 1120 kN, calculate the thrust at sea level. Compare the sea-level and vacuum thrust values with those obtained by replacing the divergent nozzle with a sea-level adapted nozzle. Also, compare the specific impulse in a vacuum.
