<!--
The first stage engines of the Ariane 5 launcher (named Vulcain) are powered by
liquid hydrogen and oxygen, with an oxidizer-to-fuel mass flow rate ratio of
$r$ = $m_{ox}$ / $m_f$ = 5.89. The combustion chamber pressure is $p_c$ = 10
MPa. Under these conditions, a chemical equilibrium calculation, gives the
following characteristics for the combustion products:
- $T_c$ = 3636 K,
- $W$ = 13.136 kg/kmole, 
- $\gamma$ = 1.201

Assuming optimal expansion ($p_e$ = $p_a$) at the ambient pressure
corresponding to sea level ($p_a$ = 101.325 kPa), determine the Mach number
$M_e$ at the nozzle exit, the nozzle expansion ratio $\epsilon$ = $A_e$/$A_t$,
the exit temperature $T_e$, the thrust coefficient $C_F$, the characteristic
velocity $c^*$, the discharge coefficient $C_D$, and the effective exit
velocity $c$.

Next, assuming you want to design an engine with sea-level thrust equal to that
of the Vulcain engine (F = 860 kN), determine the mass flow rate $\dot{m}$, the
throat area $A_t$, and the nozzle exit area $A_e$.

By inverting equation (3.29), with a known ratio of p_e / p_c = 101.325 / 10^6
= (7 / 10^6), we find M_e = 3.393. The nozzle expansion ratio can then be found
from equation (3.35), which gives ε = 11.72. The exit temperature is calculated
using equation (3.28), T_e = 1684 K. It can be observed that the gases exiting
the nozzle are still quite hot, meaning there is energy that cannot be fully
exploited.

From equation (3.32), we find that in this case α = 0.6488. Equation (3.38),
considering that in our case the pressure term is zero (p_e = p_a), gives C_F =
1.642. Equation (3.47) gives c* = 2338 m/s, and equation (3.50) gives C_D =
0.0004277 s/m. Finally, the effective exit velocity is given by equation (2.12)
as c = 3839 m/s.

To size the engine for the desired thrust, a mass flow rate is required, which
from equation (2.6) results in ṁ = 224 kg/s. From equation (2.10), the throat
area is A_t = 0.05237 m², and the exit area is A_e = ε * A_t = 0.6137 m².
Incidentally, the Vulcain does not operate with optimal expansion at sea level,
as its nozzle is actually characterized by an expansion ratio of ε = 45.

Calculate the specific impulse and characteristic velocity, assuming the nozzle expansion ratio is `o  =  . ` and the engine operates in a vacuum. What is the propellant saving achieved by using a nozzle with `o  &  ` instead of `o  » ` for a maneuver with `Ú Ë  »    2  .` Consider that the payload is ` 8  B    ¿ 3` and the engine mass is ` Ø  = e  B   3 ¿` in the first case and ` Ø  = )  B  &¿ 3` in the second, with the remaining structural mass proportional to the propellant mass with `Ø Û  5   Ø  5 .   5   Ø  5    S B`, defining the structural mass as `    Ø  5   Ø  = .`

Note that the propellant saving is relatively small (`& Ð`) even considering there was no reduction in initial mass, which would have decreased the propellant mass needed for satellite launch.
