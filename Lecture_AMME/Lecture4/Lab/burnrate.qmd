title: Lecture 4 -- Propellant Burn Rate Estimator
---

<sub>This is an MS Excel application that estimates the burn rate coefficients
   (a,n) of a rocket propellant based on static test chamber pressure
   measurements. Requires the pressure vs time data from a pair of static test
   firings, as well as basic propellant properties. This method is intended to
   provide a simple means of deriving the fundamental burn rate parameters
   essential for the design of rocket motors utilizing the given propellant.
   For a full description of the method, visit my Simplified Method to Estimate
   Burn Rate Parameters web page. Written by Richard Nakka.
