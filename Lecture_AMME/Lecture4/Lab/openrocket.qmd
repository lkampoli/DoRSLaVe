<sub> OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows
   you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and flying
   them. The main features include: 

   - Six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation
   - Automatic design optimization 
   - Realtime simulated altitude, velocity and acceleration display 
   - Staging and clustering support 
   - Cross-platform (Java-based) 

   OpenRocket is an Open Source project licensed under the GNU
   GPL. This means that the software is free to use for whatever purposes, and
