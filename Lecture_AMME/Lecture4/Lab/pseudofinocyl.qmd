<sub>This spreadsheet computes the Kn (burning-area to throat-area ratio) for a
   Pseudo-finocyl propellant grain. A Pseudo-finocyl grain configuration
   consists of a cylindrical grain with a circular bore, from which a number of
   fins extend radially (similar to a star-grain). Five independant geometric
   variables allow for great freedom in tailoring of the Kn profile. Such a
   grain may be fabricated by casting with a suitable mandrel, or by drilling
   the core, then cutting the fin slots. Written by Richard Nakka.
