<!-- https://illinoisrocstar.github.io/Rocstar-legacy/tutorials.html#Example -->

<sub>Rocstar is a multiphysics simulation application designed for coupled
   multiphysics simulations involving fluid-structure interaction (FSI) across
   moving, reacting interfaces. Rocstar couples multiple domain-specific
   simulation packages and disparately discretized domains and provides several
   simulation-supporting services including conservative and accurate data
   transfer, surface propagation, and parallel I/O. Rocstar is MPI-parallel.
   Rocstar was originally developed at the University of Illinois Center for
   Simulation of Advanced Rockets (CSAR) under Department of Energy ASCI
   program funding.
