<sub>SRM is an MS EXCEL spreadsheet that takes user-inputted motor and grain
   geometry data and computes Kn over the duration of the motor burn, generates
   a pressure-time curve, a thrust-time curve, as well as performance
   parameters such as total impulse and delivered specific impulse. Motor
   performance data is also summarized for easy input into a trajectory
   simulation software, such as SOAR. Although primarily intended for designing
   motors using KN-Dextrose or KN-Sorbitol propellant, other propellants may be
   specified with user inputted propellant properties. Solely for cylindrical
   grain configurations, such as BATES. Written by R.A. Nakka.
