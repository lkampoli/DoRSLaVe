## Goals of space propulsion

**propellere** (latin) = "push forward"

<!-- <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">&nbsp;</p>  -->

<div style="height: 30px;"></div> 

### In order to:
- attain very high speed
- overcome gravity/aerodynamic forces
- maneuvers
- attitude adjustment
- decelerate (re-entry, soft landing)

**Thrust** generated as reaction to expulsion of a propellant fluid

**Key requirement**: lightweight (both engine and propellants) and cost

---

## Thrust generation

- Reaction to ejection of propulsive fluid momentum:
  - rocket engine: propellants stored on board $\rightarrow$ products

## Engineering goal

- attain given target at minimum cost
- costs of a space mission:
  - launcher, payload, launch operations, monitoring, insurance, propellants

<!--

<img src="figs/fig-cost-breakdown.png" alt="Cost breakdown of a launch system" width="200%">

* Propulsion system dominating: 44% to 59%; > 70% including tanks

---

## Why using rockets?

**Space missions require:**

- very high speed
- operating outside the atmosphere

### Jet engine: $f \approx \dot{m} (u_e - v)$

### Rocket: $f = \dot{m} u_e + a_e (p_e - p_a)$

- **Thrust jet engine**: limited by $u_e - v$
- **Rocket thrust**: independent of $v$ →  any $v$ can be attained (in principle)

where $u_e$ is the jet exit velocity and $v$ is the aircraft/rocket speed

- **For an orbit at h = 0 →  r = $R_{E,\text{equat}}$: $v_c = \sqrt{\frac{3.986 \times 10^{14}}{6378 \times 10^3}} \approx 7905 \ \text{m/s}$

- For orbit at h = 200 km →  $v_c \approx 7800 \ \text{m/s}$

- **$\Delta v$**: ideal

## Space missions requirements (∆v)

* Propellant mass > 80% → tight coupling between design of launcher and propulsion system

* High cost orbit injection:
  - LEO (low earth orbit)
  - GEO (geostationary equatorial orbit)
  - cost GEO ≃ cost LEO x (5÷10)

<p align="center">A quasi 1D duct.</p>

:::

--- 

<!--
In steady flow conditions, the mass flow rate entering the duct must equal the
mass flow rate exiting the duct. Therefore, in differential and finite terms,
we have respectively:
-->

For **mass conservation**:

$$ \rho u A = (\rho + d\rho)(u + du)(A + dA) \quad \Rightarrow \quad d(\rho u A) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{m} = \rho u A = \text{const.} $$

For **momentum conservation**:
 
$$ \dot{m}(u + du) - \dot{m}u = pA + \left(p + \frac{dp}{2}\right)dA - \left(p + dp\right)(A + dA) \quad \Rightarrow \quad dp + \rho u du = 0 $$

For **energy conservation**:

$$ \dot{m} \left[e + \frac{u^2}{2} + d \left(e + \frac{u^2}{2} \right) \right] - \dot{m} \left(e+\frac{u^2}{2}\right) = puA - (p + dp)(u + du)(A + dA) $$ 

$$ \dot{m} d\left(e + \frac{u^2}{2}\right) + d(puA) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{m} d\left(e + \frac{u^2}{2}\right) + d\left(\dot{m} \frac{p}{\rho}\right) = 0 $$

$$ \dot{m} d\left(e + \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{u^2}{2}\right) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad dh_0 = 0 $$

---

$$ Tds = dh - dp/\rho \quad \Rightarrow \quad Tds = dh + udu = dh_0 = 0 $$

$$ dh - dp/\rho = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{T}{T_c} = \left(\frac{p}{p_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} $$

Thus: $h_0 = h_c = const., T_0 = T_c = const., p_0 = p_c = const.$

From the energy eq. we obtain the velocity at a generic nozzle section:

$$
u_e = \sqrt{2(h_c - h_e)} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma - 1} R T_c \left(1 - \frac{T_e}{T_c}\right)}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad 
u_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{\mathcal{R} T_c}{\mathcal{M}} \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}\right]}
$$

$$u_{lim} = \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{\mathcal{R}T_c}{\mathcal{M}}} \quad \text{and} \quad u_e = u_{lim} \sqrt{\left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right]}$$

---

<!--
$$
u_e = \sqrt{2(h_c - h_e)} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma - 1} R T_c \left(1 - \frac{T_e}{T_c}\right)}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad 
u_e = \sqrt{\frac{2 \gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{\mathcal{R} T_c}{\mathcal{M}} \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}\right]}

![Variation of the ratio between exit velocity and limiting velocity as a function of the expansion ratio.](figs/fig16.3.png)

<!--
This equation allows for important considerations about the quantities on which
the velocity depends and its maximum achievable value for given conditions in
the combustion chamber. First of all, it is observed that \( u \) increases
with the increase of the expansion ratio \( \frac{p_e}{p_c} \) and the term \(
\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \), and that it also depends on the value of \( A_t
\). It is also noted that for \( \frac{p_e}{p_c} \to 0 \), the exit velocity
tends asymptotically to its maximum value, called the limiting velocity.
-->
---

We also want to express the mass flow rate as a function of nozzle characteristic variables:

$$
\dot{m} = \rho_* u_* A_* = \rho_t u_t A_t
$$

$$
u_t = a_t = \sqrt{\gamma R T_t} = \sqrt{\gamma R T_c \left(\frac{T_t}{T_c}\right)} = \sqrt{\gamma R T_c \left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_t^2}\right)} = \sqrt{\gamma R T_c} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{1/2}
$$

$$ \rho_t = \rho_c \left(\frac{\rho_t}{\rho_c}\right) = \frac{p_c}{R T_c} \left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_t^2}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1} = \frac{p_c}{RT_c} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1} 
$$

$$
\dot{m} = \frac{p_c}{RT_c} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \sqrt{\gamma R T_c} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^{1/2} A_t = \frac{p_c A_t}{\sqrt{RT_c}} \sqrt{\gamma \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}}
$$

$$\dot{m} = \frac{\Gamma p_c A_t}{\sqrt{R T_c}} \quad \text{where} \quad \Gamma = \sqrt{\gamma \left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1} \right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}}$$

<!--
It is observed that \( \dot{m} \) depends only on \( A_t \) and varies little
with it, assuming values between 0.63 and 0.67 for \( A_t \) between 1.1 and
1.3. Expression (16.14) highlights the direct proportionality between \( u \)
and \( \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \), as well as the molar mass \( M \)
(recalling \( R = \frac{R_u}{M} \)), and the inverse proportionality between \(
u \) and \( T_c \). Regarding the functional dependencies of the mass flow
rate, it should be noted that the established value of the mass flow rate is a
function of the conditions in the combustion chamber (e.g., injection
conditions or characteristics of the solid propellant, depending on the case)
and the throat area. Therefore, the value of \( \frac{p_e}{p_c} \) will also
depend on the value of \( A_t \). The values of \( T_c \), \( M \), and \( A_t
\) are specific to the propellant considered.

![Volume of control for the derivation of the thrust expression for an endoreactor.](figs/fig3.3.png)
<!--
The air around the thruster is at rest, and the thruster cannot move because it
is constrained, experiencing a reaction force exactly equal to the thrust it
produces. Therefore, we assume a steady-state operation, characterized by a
mass flow rate of propellant, and a quasi-one-dimensional flow with velocity \(
V_e \) of the fluid at the nozzle exit section. A stationary control surface is
considered, which intersects the jet perpendicularly, passing through the
nozzle exit plane. The reaction to the thrust, which holds the thruster in
place, is an external force acting on the control volume. In addition to this,
the pressure forces acting on the control surface must also be considered. The
momentum equation for the control volume, projected along the direction of the
rocket axis (unit vector \( \hat{i} \), while \( \hat{n} \) is the unit vector
normal to the control surface, taken as positive in the outward direction, see
Fig. 3.3), is given by:
-->
$$\sum F_x = \int_V \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho u) dV + \int_A \rho u (u \cdot \hat{n}) dA$$

<!--
where \( F_x \) is the axial component of a generic force \( F \) acting on the
control volume, and \( u_x \) is the axial component of the fluid velocity \( u
\). If \( A_e \) is the area of the nozzle exit section, the mass flow rate of
propellant ejected from the thruster is \( \dot{m} = \rho_e u_e A_e \) (see
Lecture 2). Furthermore, since steady flow in the nozzle has been assumed, and
the fluids outside the thruster and inside the tanks are at rest, the time
derivative in Equation 3.4 is zero. Thus, only the surface integral remains,
which, since \( u = 0 \) over the entire control surface except at the nozzle
exit section of area \( A_e \), where it equals \( u_e \), becomes (assuming
quasi-one-dimensional flow):
-->

$$\sum F_x = \dot{m} u_e$$

<!--
Therefore, the forces acting on the control volume still need to be identified.
It is easily seen that the resultant is given by:
-->

$$F_{thrust} = \dot{m} u_e - A_e (p_e - p_\infty)$$

<!--
since, as mentioned, $p_e$ (in magnitude), and to calculate the pressure
forces acting on the control volume, it is necessary to introduce the negative
sign to the unit vector $\hat{n}$. The expression can be simplified by
noting that:
-->

$$\int_A (p_e - p_\infty) dA = A_e (p_e - p_\infty)$$

so the second term in Equation 3.6 can equivalently be expressed as an integral
over $A_e$:

$$\int_A p_e dA = A_e p_e$$

Thus, we finally obtain:

$$F_{thrust} = \dot{m} u_e + A_e (p_e - p_\infty)$$

And finally:

$$\dot{m} u_e = F_{thrust} + A_e (p_e - p_\infty)$$

<!--
The expression for the thrust of an endoreactor therefore includes two terms.
The first, which is generally much greater than the second, is called the
impulsive thrust term, and is proportional to the mass flow rate of the
propellant and the velocity at which it is expelled. The second term is called
the pressure thrust, and it can be negative, zero, or positive depending on
whether the pressure at the exit section is less than, equal to, or greater
than the ambient pressure. In particular, note that for a motor whose operating
conditions (mass flow rate, velocity, and pressure at the nozzle) are
unaffected by the ambient pressure (as is the case for an endoreactor), there
is a linear dependence of thrust on ambient pressure.

It is interesting to observe that there is a dependence on the external
environmental conditions, through the pressure thrust term, while there is no
dependence on flight speed. This latter consideration may seem obvious when
considering that the expression was derived under the assumption of a
stationary flow in the test chamber, but it should be noted that this
expression remains unchanged even in the more general case of an endoreactor in
flight. In fact, even in the presence of an external flow impacting the
thruster, nothing changes for the forces acting inside it that generate the
thrust.

As will be seen from the study of the nozzle, the condition \( p_e = p_{\infty}
\) is particularly interesting. This occurs when the jet is expelled at
subsonic speeds, or when the nozzle expands the flow in the supersonic regime
exactly until it reaches a pressure equal to \( p_{\infty} \). In these cases,
the nozzle is said to be adapted, and the thrust is therefore reduced to only
the impulsive thrust term.
-->

### Equivalent (or Effective) Exhaust Velocity

<!--
It has been shown that the expression for the thrust becomes particularly
simple for an endoreactor with an adapted nozzle, as only the impulsive thrust
term appears. However, even in the more general case of a non-adapted nozzle,
the impulsive term is predominant over the pressure term, so it is convenient
to introduce a fictitious velocity (denoted by $V_{eq}$), called the
equivalent (or effective) exhaust velocity, such that:
-->

$$F = \dot{m} V_{eq}$$

In the case of an adapted nozzle, the equivalent exhaust velocity is equal to
the mean (one-dimensional) exhaust velocity of the jet, while in the more
general case, it is given by:

$$V_{eq} = V_e + \frac{A_e(p_e - p_{\infty})}{\dot{m}}$$

---

What is the expansion ratio that gives the maximum thrust?

$$dF = \dot{m} du_e + (p_e - p_a)dA_e + A_e dp_e$$

$$
\begin{align*}
dF &= \rho_e u_e A_e du_e + A_e dp_e + (p_e - p_a) dA_e \\
   &= (\rho_e u_e du_e + dp_e) A_e + (p_e - p_a) dA_e \\
   &= (p_e - p_a) dA_e
\end{align*}
$$

<span style="color: blue;">Adapted nozzle!</span>

<!--The thrust is independent of $\mathcal{M}$ and $T_c$, directly dependent on
$p_c A_t$, $\gamma$ and expansion ratio.-->

Expression of the thrust of a nozzle:

$$F = \dot{m}_p u_e = \Gamma p_c A_t \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma-1} \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right]} + \frac{A_e}{A_t} \left( \frac{p_e}{p_c} - \frac{p_a}{p_c} \right)$$

Then, we can define the thrust coefficient:

$$C_F = \frac{F}{p_c A_t} = \Gamma \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma-1} \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right]} + \frac{A_e}{A_t} \left( \frac{p_e}{p_c} - \frac{p_a}{p_c} \right)$$

$$ \text{nozzle expansion ratio:} \epsilon = \frac{A_e}{A_t} = \frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma}{\gamma-1} \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^\frac{2}{\gamma} \left[1 - \left(\frac{p_e}{p_c}\right)^\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right]}}$$

but given $\epsilon$ there are 2 solutions for $p_e/p_c$
<!--

$$C_F = f(\gamma, \epsilon, \frac{p_c}{p_a})$$

![Thrust coefficient $C_F$ of an adapted nozzle as a function of the expansion ratio and specific heat ratio.](figs/fig3.5.png)

- Separation for $p_e < (0.25 ÷ 0.4) p_a$
- Higher ratios $p_c/p_a$ → higher $C_F$ but require higher $\epsilon$ = $A_e/A_t$ → higher nozzle weight, friction losses

Let's introduce another characteristic parameter of SRMs, the **Specific Impulse**:

$$I_{sp} = \frac{u_{eq}}{g_0} = \frac{F}{\dot{m_p}g_0} = \frac{1}{g_0} \left(\frac{p_c A_t}{\dot{m_p}} \right) C_F = \frac{c^* C_F}{g_0}$$

$$c^* = \frac{p_c A_t}{\dot{m}_p} = \frac{\sqrt{R T_c}}{\Gamma} = \frac{1}{\Gamma} \sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{R} T_c}{\mathcal{M}}}$$

The specific impulse:
<ul style="line-height: 1.05;">
  <li>increases with $T_C$</li>
  <li>decreases with $\mathcal{M}$</li>
  <li>has a maximum when $\epsilon$ is such that $p_e = p_a$</li>
  <li>slighlty increases with $p_c$ thanks to the increases of the pressure term in $C_F$</li>
</ul>

## Tsiolkovsky equation

- **Relates propellant mass to required $\Delta v$**

**Assumptions:**

1. Thrust $F$ is the only force on the rocket
2. Thrust is aligned with the rocket's speed
3. Effective exhaust velocity $u_{eff} = \frac{F}{\dot{m}} = \text{const}$

$$\sum{F_e} = \frac{dq}{dt} \quad \text{on motion axis} \quad \rightarrow \quad \sum{F_e} = \frac{dq}{dt}$$

$$q = mv = (m + dm) (v + dv) + (-dm) (v - u_{eff})$$
  
$$dv = - u_{eff} \frac{dm}{m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta v = u_{eff} \ln \frac{m_0}{m_f}$$
 
<!--
$$m_p = m_0 - m_f$$
-->

<!--
## After tsiolkovsky equation
-->

- **$\frac{\Delta v}{u_{eff}}$ Reduced Velocity Increment**

  $$MR = exp \left(-\frac{\Delta v}{u_{eff}} \right)$$

  $$
  \Delta v = u_{eff} \ln \left( \frac{m_0}{m_f} \right)
  $$
  
  $$
  \Delta v = -u_{eff} \ln \left( MR \right)
  $$

## Overcoming Tsiolkovsky’s equation limits

- **Assumptions in Tsiolkovsky’s Equation:**
  - $F$ is the only force and is aligned with the rocket's velocity $v$
  - There are also weight and aerodynamic drag
  - $F$ is not perfectly aligned with $v$ during ascent

- **Propulsive Losses:** $\Delta v_{real} = \Delta v_{ideal} - \Delta v_{losses}$

- **Introducing Effective $\Delta v$:** $\Delta v_{eff} = \Delta v_{ideal} + \Delta v_{losses}$

- **Using Tsiolkovsky’s Equation with Effective $\Delta v_{eff}$**

- $\Delta v_{losses}$, depends on specific trajectory.

- E.g., for a launch to LEO: $\Delta v_{losses} = 1600-2000 m/s \rightarrow \Delta v_{LEO} \approx 9500 m/s$
    
- Up to 465 m/s can be recovered from an equatorial launch due east

 $u_{eff}$ is not constant, especially for the first stage and during blowdown conditions in satellites.

## Mass ratio as a function of reduced ∆v

![](figs/fig1.3.png)

- But what really matters is the payload ratio λ = mpl/m0

---

## Payload ratio

$$\lambda = \frac{m_{pl}}{m_f - m_s} = \frac{m_{pl}}{m_0 - m_s} = MR - \frac{m_s}{m_0}$$

$$MR = \exp \left( -\frac{\Delta v}{u_{eff}} \right), \qquad m_s = \frac{m_p \cdot \kappa_s}{1 - \kappa_s}$$

$$\lambda = 1 - \frac{1 - \kappa_s}{1 - MR}$$

- **Desired Characteristics:**
  - High $u_{eff}$ (effective exhaust velocity)
  - Low $\kappa_s$ (structural coefficient)
  - but ...
