And the pressure thrust?\nSOLUTION\nThe thrust equation is: [ n # 5 = = Q = : . ]\nThe pressure in the combustion chamber is calculated using the thrust data and the given conditions: [ · R B B X ° &lt; ; ]\nThe saturated nozzle conditions imply: [ SR ̧ Q ]\nFor a saturated nozzle: [ = Z = R = R n 1 R R ) R # Q D o Z ma ) A . ]\nSo, the impulsive thrust is: [ = 5 ]\nThe pressure thrust is: [ = 5 1⁄2 n = 5 = # = R V X ́ A Z R Q = # D Q Z 3⁄4 & ́ ]\n\n\n4.2 A rocket engine using liquid hydrogen and oxygen consumes ( » ¿ 3 ) of ( À ) ) per second. The oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratio is ( 3⁄4 ¿ 3 ) of ( Á ) ) for every ( ¿ 3 ) of ( À ) ). The total temperature of the combustion gases is ( ° Â ) and the total pressure in the nozzle (adiabatic and isentropic) is ( B μ Ã ¶ ).

The propellant has an average molecular weight of B 3⁄4 2 3 ¡ Ó . 3 ¿, and the combustion temperature is ° °   Â .\nSOLUTION\nGiven the thrust and specific impulse, the propellant flow rate can be calculated as: [ n . , 5 B Ä U S Ä ¿ 3 . . ]\nUsing the flow rate expression: [ m D Z . k ]\nTo find ( Z ), we need ( ).

Compare this with the thrust obtained with a nozzle identical in every respect except the exit area, designed to be adapted to Q   S   ° Ã μ ¶.

    "text": "Past student feedback\n\nBest parts of the course? Project\n\n“Having an open ended project allowed me to do something I had interest in.”\n\n\n“The assignment was really good as it gave you ownership of what problem to choose and investigate. The course itself is super interesting and insightful, and really practical since time isn’t wasted on coding but rather the concepts and how to apply these models.”\n\n\n\nThe style\n\n“I think the hands–on approach to learning how to code up CFD solver was quite useful. Not going too deeply into the inner workings models (some ways this might happen would be deriving certian formulas and proofs of certian theorems) allowed us to devote more attention to learning how worked in an intuitive way. This perhaps is more helpful for a first timer to the subject area. I think that being too entrenched in the theorem–and–proof style of learning, though instilling rigor to the course as well as being entertaining to the geniuses and masochists, can make content too heavy and turgid for most. Having a lighter approach is more suitable to the needs of us students and allows us to gain a sufficient grasp of more types of numerical CFD solvers.”\n\n\n\nComments put in the wrong form\nNot about the course but about me:\n\n“crazy amount of interest in field demonstrated by lecturer. Amazing personality.”\n\n\n“He carried some of that young energy with him.”\n\n\n\nImprovements\nWhat could be improved?\n\n“More time for the project and removal of the final exam. I believe this project can reflect the real world even more if we had more time.”\n\nThere were others related to deadlines and number of assignment tasks, which were already implemented.\nThe next slides are answering the question: Is there anything you wish you could have told your former self before starting to help them be prepared to learn these topics?\n\n\nBrushing up on Maths, Physics and Coding\n\n“In hindsight, a piece of advice I would give my past self before starting this course would be to have a solid grasp of basic mathematical manipulations. I believe reinstating such prerequisites would greatly enhance the ability for students to fully thrive in this course.”\n\n\n“Something I wish I could have told my former self before taking this course, was to brush up on general Fortran/C++/Python skills”.\n\n\n\nTime management\n\n“If I could give advice to my former self it would be to start the project early and try to read ahead. Looking forward, I hope to continue to be able to learn more about propulsion and rocket science and am glad to have been exposed to resources like real numerical solvers.”\n\n\n“Something that I would have told my former self before starting is to not fall behind in the early stages of the term as the first couple weeks really builds the foundation for the remaining weeks of the term. Because I fell behind earlier, it was quite difficult for me to catch up during the rest of the term.”\n\n\n“Moreover, I would still ask myself to start assignments earlier instead of leaving until the last minute.”\n\n\n\nPlanning\n\n“If I could tell my former self something before starting, it would be to really focus on understanding the concepts first before jumping into coding the techniques. I think I could have saved a lot of time in the assignment if I spent more time understanding the concepts in more depth instead of rushing into the coding aspect of things.”\n\n\n“In terms of the assignment and coding I would have told my former self to do things properly the first time rather than doing a rough job and having to go back and fix it. Going back and altering early code can lead to really frustrating problems later so I would have told myself to not be lazy in the initial stages because it makes life a lot easier towards the end of the project.”\n\n\n\nPatience\n\n“If I could go back and advise my former self before starting the course, I would emphasise the importance of patience. Rocket science can be quite challenging, and it’s easy to get discouraged when facing complex models and dependences. I would advise myself to just clear my mind then come back when this happens, rather than rack my brain for hours to no avail.”\n\n\n“If I was give some advice to my former self, I would say that coding takes a long time to master and be prepared to put in the time and effort. There were some assignments which I really struggled to understand the concept, resulting in many errors (some of which were just caused by language behaviour I was not aware of) and many hours of debugging.”\n\n\n\nDon’t panic\n\n“If I could go back to tell my former self (when I was struggling to work with the first ever assignment), I would tell myself that do not panic and read the lecture slides carefully. The slides are actually extremely helpful in tackling the assignment questions.”"

Not going too deeply into the inner workings models (some ways this might happen would be deriving certian formulas and proofs of certian theorems) allowed us to devote more attention to learning how worked in an intuitive way. This perhaps is more helpful for a first timer to the subject area. I think that being too entrenched in the theorem–and–proof style of learning, though instilling rigor to the course as well as being entertaining to the geniuses and masochists, can make content too heavy and turgid for most. Having a lighter approach is more suitable to the needs of us students and allows us to gain a sufficient grasp of more types of numerical CFD solvers.”"
